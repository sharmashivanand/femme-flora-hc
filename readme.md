== Description ==

A beautiful theme with a feminine touch. Comes with customizable header, logo, fonts and a pleasant feminine floral appearance. Uses truecolor png rendering for header image.

Femme Flora now offers even more flexibility by allowing you to customize your site via WordPress Customizer. The theme allows you to control the layout widths, colors, choose between full-width and boxed layout and includes many other options that makes the site design and layout customizations a lot more easy for you.

Femme Flora is now powered by Convertica which is in-turn powered by Hybrid Core. This ensures that your site is optimized for performance and sticks to pure WordPress standards.

Convertica is a solid base theme powered by Hybrid Core 3.0 that I use to build and deliver customer-websites.
